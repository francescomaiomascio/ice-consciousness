This repository implements the **Consciousness domain** of the ICE ecosystem.

ICE Consciousness is responsible for **continuity of meaning over time**:
memory, knowledge, historical causality, and long-term semantic coherence
across systems, executions, and decisions.

This project provides **cognitive infrastructure**, not authority and not execution.

---

## Position in the ICE Architecture

ICE Consciousness is a **downstream implementation domain**.

- Conceptual authority is defined in **ICE Foundation**
- Execution and enforcement are handled by **ICE Runtime / Engine**
- ICE Consciousness supplies **memory, context, and historical grounding**

This repository must comply with:
- ICE Axioms
- ICE Structural Invariants
- Foundation boundaries (especially authority, determinism, traceability)

It does not extend or redefine them.

---

## Core Responsibilities

ICE Consciousness is responsible for:

- Long-term and episodic memory modeling
- Semantic memory and knowledge representation
- Knowledge graphs and relational context
- Embeddings as cognitive artifacts
- Retrieval and relevance scoring
- Temporal continuity of decisions and state meaning
- Historical explainability (“why this state exists now”)

---

## What ICE Consciousness Does *Not* Do

ICE Consciousness does **not**:

- Execute actions or workflows
- Orchestrate systems
- Enforce permissions or authority
- Decide what is allowed to happen
- Act autonomously

It provides **signals and context**, never commands.

---

## Cognitive Model

ICE Consciousness operates on multiple memory strata:

- **Semantic memory** — structured knowledge and meaning
- **Episodic memory** — events, decisions, historical traces
- **Working memory** — transient context for reasoning
- **Derived patterns** — long-term abstractions over time

Machine-learning components are used as **signals**, not as authorities.

---

## Interaction with Other Domains

ICE Consciousness is consumed by:

- ICE Runtime (contextual grounding)
- ICE Engine (reasoning support)
- ICE AI / agents (memory and recall)
- Observability and governance layers (historical reconstruction)

All interactions are constrained by Foundation-defined invariants.

---

## Status

This project is under **active development**.

Interfaces, storage models, and cognitive strategies may evolve,
but must always remain compliant with the ICE Foundation.
