ICE Conscious is the **cognitive layer** of the ICE ecosystem.

It models memory, knowledge, embeddings, and semantic context in order to
support awareness, retrieval, and reasoning across intelligent systems.

ICE Conscious does not execute actions.
It provides **meaning, continuity, and context**.

---

## Core Responsibilities

ICE Conscious is responsible for:

- Modeling semantic, episodic, and working memory
- Managing knowledge graphs and domain representations
- Generating and scoring embeddings
- Supporting retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- Providing cognitive signals to runtimes and agents
- Preserving continuity across sessions and time

---

## Cognitive Scope

ICE Conscious operates at the **meaning layer** of the system.

It does not:
- orchestrate execution
- manage lifecycles
- enforce system permissions
- expose user interfaces

It does:
- model knowledge and memory
- interpret context and intent
- score relevance and salience
- support long-term awareness

---

## Design Principles

- Separation between cognition and execution
- Explicit memory models (semantic, episodic, working)
- Knowledge represented as structured graphs
- Embeddings treated as first-class artifacts
- RAG pipelines as composable primitives
- ML components used as signals, not authorities

---

## Usage

ICE Conscious is not intended to run independently.

It is consumed by:
- ICE Runtime
- ICE Engine
- ICE AI
- Agent and reasoning layers within the ICE ecosystem

It exposes contracts and primitives used to **think**, not to act.

---

## Status

This project is under **active development**.
Internal APIs may evolve as cognitive models mature.
